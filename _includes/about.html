                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>I am a designer, illustrator, and ux enthusiast in Orlando, Florida. After going to University of Central Florida I thought I needed to relocate to find tech but I stayed and watched it blossom here in my backyard. My tools of the trade are pen and paper, ink, and software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch App, and Invision. I like applying my skills to projects that I think better the world, and make it a joy to live in. I also have my own cat-themed illustration business called <a href="http://www.purritopress.com"> Purrito Press.</a> I am also a Co-Captain for <a href="http://www.codefororlando.com"> Code for Orlando</a>, a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org"> Code for America</a> Brigade. We create apps that make Orlando the best place to live, work, or play. I have 1 cat, 1 dog, and 1 husband. We like to do things together, like play Dungeons and Dragons and travel. When I am not freelancing I work as a design instructor at <a href="http://www.Skillcrush.com">Skillcrush.</a></p>
