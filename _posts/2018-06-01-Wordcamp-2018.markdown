description: I worked for the Wordcamp Orlando Conference leading design direction for the conference. I designed the logo, and helped manage a very small team to deliver other designs. Through a collaborative effort we delivered a theme for 2018, a website, swag and marketing materials, a booklet, shirt design, and badge designs.
