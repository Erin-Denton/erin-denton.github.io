description: This was designed for Space Apps Orlando, an annual and nationally affiliated hackathon that aims at create apps using data and challenges supplied by NASA. This design needed to reflect the national branding of the campaign, but have Orlando flair. One with a shuttle, with our neighbors on the Space Coast, we see launches from our own yards. The other, with our beautifyl downtown city scape under the stars.
