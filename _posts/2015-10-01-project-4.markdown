description: This map was created for WordCamp Conference goers to find their way around the Exchange Building First Floor, as well as refer to the back for program details. This map folds and design are inspired by the Marauder's map. The entire map was drawn and designed with specific detail to add to the magical theme. The illustration of the building matches that of the building attendees are in, The Exchange Building in downtown Orlando. The walls have written in them WordPress functions, and the fading steps are taken by WordCamp Organizers. This was a really fun project to work on.
