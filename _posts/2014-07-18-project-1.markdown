description: This was a logo illustration hybrid created for Canvs' first year anniversary celebration. The logo was printed on stickers, canvases, and other marketing collateral. The design was also encorporated into a web-invite, and a billboard. To create this illustration I used hand drawn elements that were compiled in Photoshop for the final design.
