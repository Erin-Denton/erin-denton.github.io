description: This is a high fidelity wireframe I designed for Dinosaur Iceberg, a custom wordpress site design/development company. Using existing logo, I finished fleshing out the brand by adding web typography, color schemes, and concept for the landing page. My concept was for as you scroll down you dive "deeper under water" and thus dive deeper into what the company does. I used Sketch to create this wireframe.
