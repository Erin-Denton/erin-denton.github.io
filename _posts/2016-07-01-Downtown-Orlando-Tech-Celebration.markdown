description: This was designed for the Downtown Orlando Tech Celebration, celebrating tech startups and the tech community in Orlando. I decided to use the fountain as a beacon of downtown orlando but give it a more techy vibe. I made several logo alternates which were used in different types of advertisments. As with all of my logo designs, I start out with pencil and paper and then start moving things to the computer.
