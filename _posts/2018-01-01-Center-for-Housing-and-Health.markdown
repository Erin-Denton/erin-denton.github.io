category: Website design 
description: AIDS Chicago asked me to work on a redesign of their site for their Center for Housing and Health as well as their Better Health through Housing program landing page. They wanted a more people focused site that could help direct people to the help they need as well as partners to learning about their mission. This is just the home page but you can view the site in its entirety here <a href="http://housingforhealth.org/">http://housingforhealth.org/</a>
