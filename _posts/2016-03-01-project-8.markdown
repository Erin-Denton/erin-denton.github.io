description: This illustration was commissioned to commemorate a huge company milestone for the company PowerDMS. The final poster was printed on cotton rag, framed, and hung in the development area in their office in Orlando, Fl. The concept behind the piece is to symbolize a multi year migration of the customers using a local version of their product to a cloud solution. The poster has symbolism relative to the team involved, such as the number of database migrations (balloons) and individuals involved (ropes). PowerDMS' logo, the power symbol, can be found in the stars as well.
