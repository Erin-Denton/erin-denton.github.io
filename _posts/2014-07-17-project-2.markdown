description: This was designed for David Bisset to use at the "Happiness Bar" at the WordCamp Miami 2016 Conference. The Happiness Bar is a physical place, simmilar to Apple's Genius Bar, where conference goers can get help from experts on WordPress. David wanted to give out candy bars with special wrappers to attendees when they used the Happiness Bar.
