description: I designed this logo for the Emerald Coast Juniors, part of the General Federation of Women's Club network. The group is targeting young girls and parents aiming to promote volunteering, developing young women, and improving the community. I provided a mini brand style guide with different logo treatments and brand colors. Here are the main logo (top) alternate badge style logo in full color and in one color.
