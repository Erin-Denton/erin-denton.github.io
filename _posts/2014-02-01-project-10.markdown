description: I designed this logo to represent my cat themed illustration business. The logo represents a "purrito" which if you did not know, is a cat wrapped in a blanket like a burrito that purrs. I create and print all of my illustrations in house and I sell them online and at conventions. My etsy store has some examples of my work under this name <a href="http://www.purritopress.com">www.purritopress.com</a>.
