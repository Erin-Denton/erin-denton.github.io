client: WordCamp Orlando
category: Shirt design 
description: This design was for WordCamp's conference in Orlando, which had a Lego theme. I also designed a variation of the Wampuu holding a lego brick which was used to make an enamel pin. There is one brick missing at the top of the shirt, the idea was that when you pinned the Wampuu to your shirt, he was holding your missing brick.
