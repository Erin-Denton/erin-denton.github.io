description: As Co-Captain and member of Code for Orlando I design a lot of Code For Orlando's material. This was for one of our hackathons that we partnered with Orlando Sentinel on called Tabs on Tally. We needed a simple badge to put on social media, websites, and presentations to identify our event with. When I create visuals for Code for Orlando I like to use as many open source resources as I can to help promote the open course community. In this designed I used an icon of a government building from a resourced called The Noun Project.
